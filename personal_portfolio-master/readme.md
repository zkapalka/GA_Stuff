# Personal Portfolio v1

## Overview

This was one of our first projects. This was designed for us to dive into HTML and CSS to see how we can create a front-end portfolio with a relatively blank canvas.

## Rationale 

I wanted to see what I could do with various CSS rules, so, I included a lot of on-mouse-hover effect and tried to get a better understanding of how CSS can be leveraged. But I wanted to be able to put out a working prototype of what my portfolio could look like.
