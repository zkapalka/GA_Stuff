## What to Expect (10 min)

- Programming is not about learning a sequence of steps. It's about developing a mindset to solve problems and think programmatically.
- Progamming language not as important as:
    - Critical/analytical/programmatic thinking.
    - Conceptualizing, not simply memorizing, ideas.
        - The internet is your notebook/memory.
    - Being able to adapt quickly.
- Deal with the chaos in your head. Being confused/lost is NORMAL. No one pays you because you know all the answers. A developer's job is to jump into confusion and find a solution.
- Development can be very personal. It's about:
	- Debugging your own mistakes.
	- Being a good "Googler" and reading tech documents, which takes practice.
	- Learning more by doing, rather than by listening.
- We try not to hold your hand.
	- There is a decent amount of failure that happens initially when learning web development.
		- It's good to get that out of the way before we start working.
- This course is hard work: Be prepared to devote 60-70 hours a week, minimum.
- The maximum point of learning is right at the edge of learning and panic.
