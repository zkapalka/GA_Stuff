## Keyboard Shortcuts (5 minutes)

The next three points are handy shortcuts that prevent you from having to
backspace a bunch to erase the previous command.

### `CTRL + C`

Cancel whatever you were typing before, or exit the currently running program.
Abort!

### The `up` and `down` arrows

Cycle through previous commands

### `Tab` completion

When typing a command that has a file or path as an argument, like `cd`, type
only the first few letters and hit the TAB key.

## More Terminal Keyboard shortcuts

In the long term, reduce your reliance on the mouse. More Bash keyboard
shortcuts:

`COMMAND + K` Clear the Terminal window

`OPTION + <arrow>` Move cursor by word

`CTRL + A` Go to beginning of line

`CTRL + E` Go to end of line

`CTRL + K` Kill line to end

`CTRL + U` Kill line to beginning

`CTRL + Y` Paste whatever was killed using Ctrl+K or Ctrl+U

_Nifty Navigation Command:_

`$ cd -` toggle previous directory
