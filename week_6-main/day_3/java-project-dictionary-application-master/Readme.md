Building a dictionary application - Java
==========================================

## Overview

The final project for Java is to build a terminal-based dictionary application that allows users to perform various operations on a dictionary of words and their definitions. The application will utilize the concepts learned in Java, such as data types, variables, control flow, loops, methods, scopes, arrays, ArrayLists, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), inheritance, polymorphism, abstract classes, interfaces, exception handling, file I/O, and the Java Stream API.

The dictionary application will be a command-line interface (CLI) program that runs in the console without a graphical user interface (GUI). Users will interact with the application by typing commands and receiving text-based output.


## Project Structure

Users will be able to access the app by running the Java app in IDE and the program will come pre-loaded with multiple words already included. 

Users will be able to search for words, edit, add and delete words.
