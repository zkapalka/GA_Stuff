# Project

This is the Week 4 project for the General Assembly bootcamp. This was set up to demonstrate our understanding and our ability to follow the project requirements as set forth by General Assembly.

## What is Eyeth?

Eyeth is an imaginary planet in where the majority of the populance are deaf and only a minority can actually hear. This is actually a common story among the Deaf community and setting up a job board with the word "Eyeth" signals that this is clearly aimed at the Deaf community.

It is a tongue in the cheek reference to the pun being Earth being EARth and Eyeth being EYEth.

## Log-in Page

Several items to notes

* Google and Facebook buttons are set up to alert only
* Set up to accept light/dark mode preference and will carry over
* This will allow you to either log in or register if you're a new user
* User auth is set up using local storage, and will deny you access if you don't have the right username or password
* Register first and then log in. Use local storage if you can't remember

## Job board

This is designed for Deaf people with minimal visual clutter. We keep the information concise and relevant and empower the users to make their decisions on what jobs that they want to go after.

Several things to note

* The skill sections will allow users to input their skills
* There is a Daily Quote post that will return a new quote based on refreshing of the browser 
* Users can post jobs and comment as needed.
* The sort button works on sorting automatically from oldest to newest, and newest to oldest.
* The search field allows users to filter out posts based on text returned.
* It is set up that when there's too much posts, a scroll bar will appear.
* Hamburger icon is meant as a joke
* The hamburger menu set-up in mobile view is fugly, and I gave up on that.


## Stuff I've learned

This section will cover the stuff I've learned while working on this.

* I am messy
* Built in functions are powerful. Don't shy away from using them.
* Some functions became too bloated and I screwed up by not putting some of those lines in their own functions and then calling those functions within the displayPost function. 
* Location of lines can affect the appearance and UX of those on DOM
* It's extremely important to have a wire-frame, and to build with a modular approach and test 1, 2, 3 times before adding more changes.
* It takes discipline to be able to fix a bug or set up something and focus on it instead of jumping off to something more easy.
